# Sowmya Thogiti
Hi everyone, my name is Sowmya Thogiti, you can call me Sowmya and I am a new member of the Spring Batch (2020) pursuing my Masters in Applied Computer Science.

I was born and brought up from a town named Jagtial of Telangana state in INDIA. I belong to a middle-class family and learned good ethics and values from my parents. Situations from my life made me strong and accept any kind of challenge. I am a bit practical too! I love to take responsibilities and good at initiating things to make it perfect. I have done my under-graduation from the Jyothishmathi institute of technology and science from Karimnagar (INDIA) majoring in computer science engineering in the year 2015. Since then I have worked for IBM India Pvt. Ltd for 4 years  as an SAP ABAP Consultant. My hobbies include singing, playing badminton. I love cooking which works as a stress buster for me. My favorite hobby could be sleeping!!

I would like to have software job as a Full-stack developer as full-time employee which can help me grow in my career. I would like to learn new things and apply them in real-time. I follow the saying that “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.”
